### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned that there is codes that help determine the amount of digits that will come out in the calculations. Before I thought that the system would already pre-determine it. 
2. I learn that you need to empty the string at the end of the code in order to reset the database in order to re do the application. Or else the same numbers would stay in the stream and wont recalculate.
3. I learned the difference and importance of a string and a float and how it contributes to calculations in the database.
